- Re-check my angular skill, but seem it failed xD!

## Getting start
- install dependencies by bower

    ```
    $ bower i
    ```
- (*) Running by open `index.html` meets `Cross origin requests`, I'd just tested by open `index.html` bt `Webstorm IDE`. If you meet any problems just feel free to tell me, I'll try to fix it ASAP.


It has been year I did not work with angular 1.x, thanks for send me this test, it really helps.
